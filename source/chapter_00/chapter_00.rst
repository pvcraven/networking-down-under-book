Preface
*******

Do you want to learn about computer networks, and have a little
experience with the Python computer language, and a Raspberry Pi
computer lying around? This book could be for you. Do you like to learn
by example, enjoy tinkering, hacking, creating, or just having fun with
technology? This book is *definitely* for you.

Back when I was taking a computer networking course, I felt there was
just too much theory and not enough projects. That course did not have
us, the students, network computers together. We didn’t write networking
code. I told myself if I ever taught a such a course myself, I’d teach
hands-on practical assignments.

After fifteen years of working as a software developer, I changed jobs
and became a professor. Finally, I did have a chance to teach people how
to network computers. Over time I’ve filled my class with a lot of these
hands-on projects. Understanding the theory is important, but I want
also want you to feel enabled to *do* something with that theory.

That big mysterious cloud that is the Internet? Let’s take away the
mystery. Learn how it works. Learn what you can do with computer
networking. Create.
